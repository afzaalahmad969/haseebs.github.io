Hi! I am Haseeb Shah, a BS Software Engineering student at NUST (National University of Science and Technology), Pakistan.

Currently, I am working as an intern at [TUKL-NUST R&D Centre](http://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk), where my work is primarily focused on researching and implementing Machine Learning models to solve
a specific task. I have put this website up to share information about my projects that I have worked on over the years and spread some knowledge that I have acquired through blog posts.
